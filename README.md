# NewspaperWebsiteProject
This is a project carried out for the design 1 subject in the second year of the systems analyst career.  
The idea of the project was to generate a news website where all access is through a single website for news and administration tasks. 
There is the possibility that users log in to the page and have access to CRUD forms of the different news, sections, journalists and users. 
The news is separated into National and International.  Technologies such as C #, .Net, SqlServer and LinQ are applied in this project.

To run the project you need Visual Studio 2015 or later, then download the folder and open the .sln executable.
